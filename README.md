Conducted a multiple linear regression analysis to understand the relationship between a companyâ€™s expenditures and its profit. The independent variables included R&D Spend, Administration Spend, and Marketing Spend, while Profit served as the dependent variable. The analysis aimed to:

- Determine the significance and strength of each input variable in predicting profit
- Identify which expenditure categories most strongly influence profitability
- Build a predictive model to estimate profit based on future spending strategies
